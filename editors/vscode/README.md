# Exact Contract for VS Code

Syntax highlighting and editing defaults for the current `.contract` language,
and `$exact-contract`, a problem matcher for the Contract compiler's
diagnostics. Its only runtime code, `extension.js`, does two things, each only
when a setting turns it on, and nothing without them. It has no dependencies.

- It registers `.contract` with the TypeScript 7 extension when that is
  installed and the workspace sets `js/ts.contentMappers.enabled`, so a
  project's content mapper (`editors/content-mapper`) answers hover, definition,
  references, rename and errors in a contract opened on its own.
- It formats a contract when the workspace sets `exactContract.compiler` to the
  Contract compiler's path: **Format Document** runs `contract fmt --stdin` on
  the editor's text, saved or not. Text the compiler refuses is left as it is.
  Formatting is asked for: the extension turns nothing on to run it on save.

To package and install from the repository root:

```sh
cd editors/vscode
bunx --bun @vscode/vsce package --allow-missing-repository --skip-license --out /tmp/exact-contract.vsix
code --install-extension /tmp/exact-contract.vsix --force
```

Run **Developer: Reload Window** in VS Code after installing. Repackage and
reinstall after changing the grammar. No generated package belongs in the repo.

The hand-maintained TextMate grammar is `syntaxes/exact-contract.tmLanguage.json`.
Its language sources are `contract/syntax/src/lexer.rs` and `parser.rs`; built-in
tags, events and host commands come from `contract/lower/src/tags.rs`,
`contract/analyze/src/lib.rs` (`HANDLERS`) and `contract/syntax/src/lib.rs`
(`HOST_COMMANDS`), all three listed by `contract vocab --json`; `cargo test -p
contract --test it vscode_grammar` compares the grammar's lists with them and
names any word missing or no longer the compiler's. See LLP 1006 §2 and LLP
1017.000 P1/P9 for the language and CSS names. Attribute names match structurally, including hyphens,
so adding a CSS property needs no grammar update. The compiler validates names
and values; highlighting is not validation.

Includes declarations (with `timeline`, `sound` and `color-profile`), routes,
resources (with `with`) and mutations, actions with `let` locals, host commands,
record constructors, component `provide` sections, styles, keyframes,
HTML/SVG/native tags, events, types, authored tests, double-quoted
strings, and backtick templates with nested interpolations. Single quotes are
not Contract strings. The grammar itself is no language server: what an editor
knows about a contract's names comes from `editors/content-mapper`.

## Building and testing from VS Code

`$exact-contract` reads the compiler's diagnostic lines (`file:line:col [id]
message`) into the Problems panel; an indented related note is not a problem of
its own. Tasks use it with rust-analyzer's `$rustc` for Cargo's output. Without
rust-analyzer, VS Code reports `$rustc` as unknown and runs the task anyway.

This repository's tasks are in `.vscode/tasks.json` (**Tasks: Run Task**): build
or format the open `.contract` file, the six checks one by one or in order
(`check: caps` reads what git has staged), `contract: difftest quick`, and for an
app under `apps/` (asked when the task runs) the web dev loop, its
`app.test.contract` on the web, and a run on macOS or an iOS simulator. The
default build task is `check: build` and the default test task `check: test`.

An app or a game that `exact new` makes gets its own `.vscode/tasks.json` over
its `bun exact.mjs` verbs; the default test task is `test web`. The file is the
author's after that: `bun exact.mjs update` writes it only when it is missing.

The tasks run `bun`, which must be the version `package.json` pins.

`bun test ./editors/vscode` runs the matcher against the compiler's real output
and checks the repository tasks' scripts and matchers;
`bun test game/new-app.test.mjs` checks that a new app's tasks name its verbs.
