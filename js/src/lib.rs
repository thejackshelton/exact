//! The TypeScript data-source executor (LLP 1027).
//!
//! @ref LLP 1027 D1a (`fetch` over the host's ticket path) / D2 (marshaling
//! by the plan's shapes) / D3 (the executor) / D4 (after first pixel) / D10
//! (what the module can use)
//!
//! An app's `app.ts`, bundled and compiled to Hermes bytecode at bake, is a
//! [`Module`]: a [`DataSource`] like any Rust data crate, behind the same
//! seam, answering the same `resource` and `send` declarations. The lean
//! Hermes VM runs it — bytecode only; it cannot be handed source — through
//! about two hundred lines of C++ (`shim.cc`), and the plan's `sources` table
//! says what every argument and every answer looks like, so records cross as
//! objects keyed by their declared field names and nothing is guessed.
//!
//! The module's identity and grants are the bake's outputs beside the
//! bytecode, so a host reads them at boot without an engine; the engine is
//! created by [`Module::load`], which a host calls after its first pixel
//! (D4). Until then every answer is `Unavailable`, by name.
//!
//! **The seam, from the module's side (ABI 1).** `exact.abi` is `1`;
//! `exact.appId` and `exact.grants` are strings; `exact.answer(source, args,
//! store)` returns the answer's value — or a `Promise` of it, when it awaited
//! `fetch` — and throws for an error (an object with `kind` of
//! `UnknownSource`, `BadArguments`, or `Unavailable` and a `message`; any
//! other throw is `Unavailable`). In a running session, an answer's own
//! error becomes `Failed(Error, …)`: its resource fails or send ends unsent,
//! while the asking commit stands (LLP 1027.000 D3). Bake and replacement
//! validation still refuse it. `fetch(url, init)` is the web's, over the
//! host's ticket path: the module describes, the host runs under the grants,
//! the Promise resolves to a `Response` with `status`, `ok`, `headers`,
//! `text()`, `json()`, `arrayBuffer()`. Liveness is the module's, as a
//! browser's event loop has it (LLP 1027.003.000 §13, option 1; hn-reader
//! F7): an answer that awaits a promise another answer started (a fetch
//! memoized across answers, a queue behind another's storage) waits while
//! the module has work outstanding and is asked again when its chain moves (LLP 1162 D3);
//! one that waits with nothing outstanding is refused as pending on nothing.
//! A worker-placed source runs one turn to its end, so it still refuses one.
//! `store` is `{get, set, forget}` over the runner's [`Store`]: reads
//! counted, writes grant-checked, in Rust. `console` reaches the runner's
//! logs. Time and random seeds are ordinary source arguments (LLP
//! 1027.000): ambient Date/Math.random reads and Intl.DateTimeFormat
//! formatting without an explicit timestamp refuse, including at module
//! initialization and after await. Explicit-value Date construction and UTC
//! arithmetic remain available. An answer's own `setTimeout` (and
//! `AbortSignal.timeout`) is due on the runner's clock. Its continuation
//! wakes when due or when another turn changes its wait (LLP 1162 D3);
//! the other timers refuse (LLP 1027.000 D1). `scheduler.yield()`
//! ends an answer's turn: the host asks it again at once, and it goes on in
//! a new turn with a budget of its own (LLP 1141.001 D10).
//!
//! **Interrupts (LLP 1048.000 D10).** Another thread may stop a running call
//! through [`DataSource::interrupt`]'s handle: the bake compiles with async
//! break checks, so Hermes stops at the next loop iteration or call, and the
//! call is refused as `Unavailable`. The per-call budget is still measured
//! after a call returns; an interrupt is what ends one that doesn't.
